    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Intro</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> The company was seeking to manage their claims for untracked transactions better. A lot of
      customers were still contacting customer support asking for help with that, which played a big role in increased costs and of course needed the UX improved. The old approach
      incorporated a 5 step form, and looking at data, it was clear that a significant amount of users were dropping off after step 3. </p>

    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> We use firebase in this team, so I was looking through the data to draw up some conclusions and findings.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Goal</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">To make the claims process quicker, and easier to understand, while still keeping to strict development deadlines. </p>

  <container class="responsive-container flex-column">
    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Research</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">We released a survey for users to leave feedback after they have used the claims service
    (even if they dropped off before finishing it). The results were overall quite positive from the users that took part, however,
    we are considering all of the data.</p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I started by looking at current flows to find flaws and good points in the current structure.
    I also had to liaise with the developers to see which solutions we can potentially implement. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">Looking at user feedback, user data, development requirements, paint points and positive
      points, and post workshops held with the team, I drew up a new proposed flow that potentially simplifies the process. The key here was
      to not reinvent the whole process, but to simplify the current flow so we could test and roll this out to meet deadlines.</p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The new proposed flows were wireframed and presented to the Product manager. There were some
      fundamental issues such as - user gets taken to a web page for some more information, but they need to log in again, which may have been
      one of the contributors to users dropping off towards the end of the claims process.</p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">Looking at the complete flow from start to finish (to email etc)</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">User</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I drew up the user cohorts, just so we can understand and test how a new user might approach
      this journey against an existing user and making sure the flow fits all instances and how the claims process might be useful to each
      of them.</p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">And using the current findings I was able to wireframe the updated flows and the multiple
    entry points all users may come across. </p>

      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Constraints and scope</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">We had a very limited deadline for this project, so my main focus was on what we can do in
        the time that we have. There were also dev limitations so I had to account for those in my research and designs. The end result was an
        improved and condensed version of the existing process.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Results</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">This exercise was to improve Quidco‚Äôs service or their users, which played an important
        factor in cutting costs. Instead of users reaching to customer service right away, they were guided a little more with the process,
        as well as seemingly having less steps to complete to get to their goal, so we keep their attention.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">This upgrade is calculated to save the company around ¬£500k a year for customer support, a
        huge help in the current climate of the uncertain world. It was a really critical cost-cutting project, as the company was getting
        ready for a sale, so there were many areas where we needed to improve our revenue streams.</p>
