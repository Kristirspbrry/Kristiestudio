    <h1 class="sub-title black-text">Patterns in Language</h2>
    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The problem</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> There is a common notion that learning some languages is difficult.
      It can be difficult and time consuming to understand the grammar and remember certain structures. One common issue I discovered
      through my research is that most of the language learning apps and online tools aren‚Äôt very good at explaining how something
      works in great detail. Or there is hardly any 'soul' of the language in the material. You may also have to learn an array of
      basics that aren‚Äôt immediately useful. </p>

      </section>
      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The research</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I studied several sources for Welsh lessons, both adult and children to see if there is
        much of a difference. I found that a lot of material for adult learning is very black and white and it takes a lot of concentration
        in order to learn and understand. Children‚Äôs lessons seemed a lot more engaging, however. I found that most sources also only taught
        the southern Welsh language, even though the language does differ quite a bit across the country.  </p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I really wanted to explore with using colour, sound and interaction to see how I could
        create something that is more holistic and explore all these different avenues and how they could tie together. </p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I recently found out, as uncovered by my friend who holds a PHD in cognitive neuroscience,
        that the way I saw things was called synesthesia. I have never really thought too much about it, However in this instance it really
        helped me in learning, understanding and remembering patterns of the language. I used that as part of my research to build some
      ideas for visual execution. </p>
      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The solution</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> Create a tool that will break down a language into easy to understand steps. Learning
        phrases and words that can be used in every day life is important to get someone engaged into learning from day 1. </p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> So to begin with, I created a colour coded alphabet. I used the synesthesia concept
        to underline the sounds and letters that are specific to the Welsh language and differs from English. I wanted to take an element
        of my experience and apply it in a way that could be useful to other learners.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Issues encountered along the way</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> This project undergone a great number of revisions. Both from testing with native
      speakers and the friends and family I could grab. I really enjoyed being able to work with such a huge variety of people. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> Pretty much all language courses focus on teaching the dialect that is most widely used or
      most widely accepted in literature. However, while running tests with my product, it was clear that there is quite a significant
      language diversity between certain regions in Wales. Some words are totally different! This tends to create a divide and I really
      wanted my product to be accessible and enjoyed by anyone in the country (someone did say that he couldn‚Äôt find anything that was
      north Wallian which was putting him off the course). So, to solve that issue I consulted people from across the country to record
      their pronunciations and update some of the grammar and words. </p>
      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The result</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> The final product was a course that encapsulated the Welsh language in succinct and
        fun 10 day classes. It outlines the most important grammatical points, language variations across the country with recorded
        pronunciations by the locals and builds up knowledge through progressive learning. The last lesson emulates a test, however,
        in this case it‚Äôs about being able to apply what‚Äôs been learned throughout the classes and the learners can test themselves
        if they have understood and remembered what they‚Äôve learned in the previous 9 lessons. </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The product</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I built a web page for this course, as it‚Äôs an easy access for anyone. I designed the
      content ( which included me needing to learn Welsh!), designed the layout and coded it all up. I did get some help with coding and
      of course a lot of help from the native Welsh speakers to make sure the grammar is correct. So essentially this product has been
      built by me and the welsh community.

    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I wanted to structure this in such a way that made it seem like it was easily digestable and
    not overwhelming. When I was learning and reading through the grammar I didn't have the easiest of time connecting all the dots. So
    my aim was to condense it all into easy to understand points that anyone learning could follow and grow with every lesson. These ten lessons are a mere
    introdction to the language, however aiming to build a solid foundation for a beginner. I aimed to make this course inclusive and interactive, so that
    it felt as if it was a tale, told by the Welsh speakers. Because I wondered - isn't language, being a form of sound, a tool for story telling and such. A foreign language can
    seem shrouded in myth and unfamiliarity, so my aim was to make it as human and fun as possible. The last lesson of the course encapsulates all the lessons and invites the learner to
    improvise and write a story (about a dragon of course), as a sort of end of course test, however, I aimed to make that the most fun part of the learning. </p>
