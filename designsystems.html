        <li>Building brand new design systems and libraries</li>

    <h1 class="sub-title black-text left-text">Design systems</h1>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> When I started working on the project at Quidco, there were no Design systems in place.
    It was important for me to start implementing a component based structure. The benefits of that were that I could design and prototype quicker
    and the developers understood the design guidelines a lot clearer. The Design system acted as a fallback and the holy grails for all the
    components and any new layouts we needed to add. We needed to build a lot of features really quickly at the time, so that was a great
    investment. However, it paid off over time too, for the design and the development team. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I would say one of the most important things I've learned on this project is that whenever
    there is a bigger team, or more people from different teams involved in a project, the more important it is to have a clear structure
    and clear guidelines on how we can all move forward while staying on the same page. </p>
    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Android and iOS</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> As both apps follow the native guidelines, the components needed to be adapted for both. I
    wanted to still maximise on accessibility and we kept the dynamic / responsive font, so we mapped the design system to those guidelines. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> And of course other components, such as a native 'toast' on Android had to be adapted
    to work for iOS. I wanted to approach this in a way that wouldn't result duplicating one OS's design onto another, so on iOS we may have a slightly different
    layout and sometimes flows. </p>


    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I wrote a blogpost about this on Medium <a class="button" target="_blank"

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Approach</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> The design system was initially built in Sketch, however, we decided to move to Figma
    so restructured it all on there. Figma allowed us to communicate together a lot better. Some of our team being remote and some in a
  really different time zone, Figma made it a bit easier to collaborate with everyone across the teams. </p>
  <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The design system followed an atomic structure, which made it easy to build new
  components in the future and allowed me to really set a strong base. </p>

<section class="white-bg pb4">
  <container class="responsive-container flex-column">
    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Web and the brand</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> The web app was based on Bootstrap, so the design system followed the grid and the structure
    of bootstrap to make it easy to build an implement. </p>
  <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">With the design team we set up several libraries and several toolkits in order to accommodate
  the array of products and platforms that we had. We had a library for the brand and a toolkit library that developers could have access to.
We built component libraries where all the final designs were stored and any team needing that could access. This made is super easy
to work across different platforms for us in the design team and we could pick up each others projects quite easily.</p>
