    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I joined Quidco to work on both, the iOS and Android apps. To take them from their skeleton
    stage into a fully functioning product. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> We had to build quickly, so a good solution was to use as many native elements as possible.
    However, adding more branded components as we keep developing. Both Android and iOS follow a similar structure, however the native
    elements of each platform have been taken into consideration within the design. Through our research we found that a native UI is easier
    for the users of that platform to navigate and to understand from the get-go. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I built a component library for both apps, initially on sketch and then on Figma as we
    changed platforms. </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The research</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">Through building experience maps and conducting user research, I found that a lot
    people weren't sure what 'cashback' meant. I interviewed Quidco users and those who have not really heard of cashback. Our problem was
  obvious - how can we make Quidco easier for the general public to understand and what are they looking for in their shopping experience. </p>
  <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">This lead us to look into a more visual way we could represent cashback. Looking into the future
  roadmap of potentially giving Quidco a more of a banking edge, the 'Quidco digital card' was something that we wanted to trial as an MVP. The card
  connects the concept and also acts as a component within the app. Since our customers can already withdraw the earned cashback, introducing that
  process with a card opened the doors for us to add more features to it in the future.  </p>

  <container class="responsive-container flex-column">
    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The branding</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The idea of squids comes from the British rhyming slang - quid=squid. As Quidco already
    had the word 'quid' in its name and it was started in the UK, the branding would honour the significance of that for the company. The tone
    of voice would incorporate a bit of playfulness too and we began to introduce emojis on some cases on the app. </p>
  <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> Quidco had a strong blue brand colour, which felt a little formal, so introducing more
  neural tones and brighter squids across the brand (such as with the squids colour scheme) was a way to make the brand feel more comtemporary
  and light. </p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The outcome</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The Using the findings of the user research and experience maps we built, we were able to
    add new brand elements throughout the app. This was to built a more robust brand credibility and form as more emotional or human
    connection with the customers. We discovered how storytelling has been so important for Quidco to build values and a vision for the future. </p>
  <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The app has a structure and looking how our customers use the search, navigation and categories we
  were able to consider that in the layout of the homepage - guiding the customer through the app. Currently the web app only shows promotions
  on the homepage, which concluded not to be very user friendly, so the next steps would be to move from mobile to web and improve the specific
  user needs there. </p>
