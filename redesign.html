    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Intro</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> Streetbees were a data start-up when I joined this project. We were building an app to
      collect data from hard to reach countries and people, which then was translated to a dashboard for various companies we partnered with.
      Some of the clients included Nestle, Dyson, Unilever.  </p>
      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The challenge</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> The challenge here was to really understand the goals the clients were after and how the
        data needed to be displayed. Navigation played a really important part. We built a general template but each survey needed to be
        individually designed and prepared to some extent, so when working on layouts, we needed to consider various scenarios.  </p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">It was important that the navigation had a flow from beginning to end that told a story
        about the research, and it was important for the brands (our other users) to be able to dissect and search the information in whatever
        way they needed, so via tags and filters, getting in to the small details of each project.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">To achieve that we looked at flows within navigation and also how we can dissect
        information in each step.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The objective</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The objective was to engage users to take part in survey feeds so we can collect their data
      via an app, which then would be translated as data in a dashboard for brands to access.</p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The deliverables were a mobile app for the users to take surveys and a web app dashboard
      for brands to access the collected data.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Solving problems</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">We wanted to find the best way for users to engage with our content. We looked at similar
        concepts such as Facebook / Instagram where blocks of information are displayed in a scroll format as a trend of interaction just so
        we could find a common UX pattern that would be widely recognised for our worldwide audience.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> One problem that we were faced with was fraud. We found that some users were uploading
        pictures from google or for products they haven‚Äôt actually tried. We looked at the flow of the questionnaire and working with the data
        team, added filtering questions in the surveys to eliminate users that aren‚Äôt suitable without them being able to guess exactly what
        we‚Äôre after. Only eligible users would then go through to the final stage.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">It was important for the business to keep users engaged and keep them coming back.
        One of the ideas we explored in achieving that was through engaging users in local news. The Streetbees concept was all about
        real users getting a say about their experience of a product so we wanted to keep within those boundaries, but push what opinions
        they could express further into local news and other areas of life.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The process</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">We were able to test the app with a variety of users and we were working with B2B clients
        in order to achieve their dashboards goals. The idea was that we would create data display blueprints for the future, so the work would
        not need to be manual.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I worked in a squad with web app and app developers and 2 Lead designers. I was able to work
        on some front-end projects while at Streetbees as well.</p>
