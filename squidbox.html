    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> We were given one month to design and build this game. Quidco wanted to gift its customers
      for boxing day for their loyalty, so I combined Quidco and the box concept to make Quidbox. It's a lucky dip concept which also
      beckoned players to come back each day and open the app. </p>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> As well as being an experimental project we wanted to track how the customers responded
      to the game and whether it attracted any more conversions through the app via the game. It was also a brand exercise, to add a more
       playful edge to the brand. The game was a success and we collected some good feedback from customers, which was used as a finding
       for a branding exercise.</p>

    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The process</h2>

    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> Now on to the more technical side of things. Our CEO gave us a task to build something
    as a thank you for our customers and post our ideation workshop we concluded that some sort of a game would be a nice experiment. However,
  we had a very limited amount of time. After drafting down some ideas I needed to find a way to get things done quicklly. We couldn't add
huge files to our app and we didn't have the dev capacity to build a game on the app. The solution was Lottie. I was able to illustrate and then
animate the game in After Effects and export it with Lottie. It condensed the animation files to an xml format which made it really small. We had to
plan the project and work almost side by side with each other in our team of Android and iOs developers, product manager and myself. But it was
definitely a fun project to be so much against time. </p>

  <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">The result</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> We wanted to test wether this game would invite the customers to open the app a little more
       often. They could play the game once a day. We found, comparing data to the numbers we had for the same time last year, a 50% increase
       in the app being opened. This was a quick MVP. The next progression would be to increase conversion. Currently Amazon vouchers were
       offered as a prize, but we could add exclusive discounts and voucher codes and get retailers to participate in the game as an
       advertising space, in such way making advertising a bit more fun and engaging.  </p>
