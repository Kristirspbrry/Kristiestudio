    <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Intro</h2>
    <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> This project started with a problem I aimed to solve for myself - how to learn a
      language in a quick and efficient way.</p>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">There is a common notion that learning some languages is difficult. It can be difficult
        and time consuming to understand the grammar and remember certain structures. One common issue I discovered through my research is
        that most of the language learning apps and online tools aren‚Äôt very good at explaining how something works in great detail. Or
        there is hardly any 'soul' of the language in the material. You may also have to learn an array of basics that aren‚Äôt immediately
        useful.</p>

        <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">This product encapsulates my needs as a learner, as well as the needs of the Welsh
          community and those new to Learning Welsh.</p>

          <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">It was also published and featured on the UX Collective. <a class="button" target="_blank" href='https://uxdesign.cc/synethesia-in-product-design-cd992ee4c41f'>Read it here</a></p>

        <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Research and challenges</h2>
        <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I studied and researched several sources for Welsh lessons, both adult and children
          to see if there is much of a difference. I found that a lot of material for adult learning is very black and white and it takes
          a lot of concentration in order to learn and understand. Children‚Äôs lessons seemed a lot more engaging, however. I found that
          most sources also only taught the southern Welsh language, even though the language does differ quite a bit across the country. </p>

          <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Proposed Solutions</h2>
          <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">As language is so multidimensional, it made sense to add that aspect to designing a
            language course. There is a neurological condition called synesthesia, when you may see shapes when you hear music or see colours
            with sounds. I borrowed this concept for this project.</p>

      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">So to highlight a sound I used a colour and all native Welsh sounds in the alphabet
        are coloured. This course is primarily aimed at English language speakers, so the rest of the letters that are pronounced the
        same as in English are a neutral colour.</p>

      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">This project undergone a great number of revisions. Both from testing with native speakers
        and the friends and family I could grab. I really enjoyed being able to work with such a huge variety of people.</p>

      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">Pretty much all language courses focus on teaching the dialect that is most widely used or
        most widely accepted in literature. However, while running tests with my product, it was clear that there is quite a significant
        language diversity between certain regions in Wales. Some words are totally different! This tends to create a divide and I really
        wanted my product to be accessible and enjoyed by anyone in the country (someone did say that he couldn‚Äôt find anything that was
        north Wallian which was putting him off the course). So, to solve that issue I consulted people from across the country to record
        their pronunciations and update some of the grammar and words.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Final product</h2>
      <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">The final product was a course that encapsulated the Welsh language in succinct and
        fun 10 day classes. It outlines the most important grammatical points, language variations across the country with recorded
        pronunciations by the locals and builds up knowledge through progressive learning. The last lesson emulates a test, however, in
        this case it‚Äôs about being able to apply what‚Äôs been learned throughout the classes and the learners can test themselves if they
        have understood and remembered what they‚Äôve learned in the previous 9 lessons. </p>

        <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100"> I wanted to structure this in such a way that made it seem like it was easily digestable
           and not overwhelming. When I was learning and reading through the grammar I didn't have the easiest of time connecting all the dots.</p>

       <h2 class="sub-title black-text left-text pt2">Target audience</h2>
       <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I designed this course to be accessible to children and adults alike - anyone could pick
         it up. A foreign language can seem shrouded in myth and unfamiliarity, so my aim was to make it as human and fun as possible. The
         last lesson of the course encapsulates all the lessons and invites the learner to improvise and write a story (about a dragon of
         course), as a sort of end of course test, however, I aimed to make that the most fun part of the learning.</p>

         <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">Keeping this in mind, the font face I chose was Manrope. The font in this case
         was important to me that it could convey the message, be clear and encompass my target audience. </p>

         <p class="black-text left-text pt1 pb2 w100">I received some incredible feedback from people all across the internet on this
         project. Some offered to pay for the classes, which I would conclude signified a successful outcome. </p>
